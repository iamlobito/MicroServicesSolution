# Demo using ASP.NET Web Core API // Microservices Study

In this demo I built a Web Core Api using ASP.NET core with entity framework and first database approach. 

The main goal is to provide an example of an implementation of micro service solutions using some best pratices.

In this example, I'm using the Repository Pattern to abstract the data manipulation and split the business logic layer and data access layer.
